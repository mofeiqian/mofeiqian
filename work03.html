        <p>This is a personal project to redesign the visual style of the interfaces for D3A. The D3A application was not longer in the development direction of our department, and therefore all production efforts has been stopped in 2013. However, as the head designer for the project, I was at that time in the process to update the visual style of the app, so I kept working on the task in my personal time. The redesign was more modern and slim,  it gave the app a whole new look and feel. It was a pity not be able to witness the real app be upgraded into the new skin, otherwise it would have become a cool app to play with.</p>
