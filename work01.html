        <p> A Windows 8 style app to make people enjoy playing with their photos, specially photos on <a href="http://www.snapfish.com/" target="_blank">Snapfish</a> from HP.
            This was one of the very first apps that was specifically designed and built to elaborate the touch-rich
            nature of a new modern design style from Microsoft. As the lead designer for release version 1.0 in 2012, I was
            in charged to create all the interactions, and also supervised all visual designs and implementation.</p>
